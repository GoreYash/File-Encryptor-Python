# File Shield 🛡️

A professional-grade file security utility built in Python. This tool provides robust AES-256 encryption using password-based key derivation (PBKDF2), allowing users to secure individual files or entire directories with a single master password.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Password-Based Security:** Uses **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with 100,000 iterations to generate secure keys.
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Leverages the industry-standard `cryptography.fernet` (AES) implementation.
- **Bulk Processing:** Intelligently identifies and processes every file within a directory while ignoring system-critical files like the salt.
- **Safety Guard:** Implements logic to skip sub-directories and the encryption salt to prevent accidental data loss.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Library:** `cryptography`
- **Focus Areas:** Information Technology, Cybersecurity, File I/O.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the cryptography library installed:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
2. **Run:** Execute main.py and enter a Master Password.

3. **Target:** Provide a file path (e.g., my_notes.txt) or a folder path (e.g., ./secret_docs/).

4. **Action:** Choose (1) to lock or (2) to unlock.

## ⚠️ Important Security Note
This tool relies on the X.salt file.

**DO NOT** delete X.salt.

**DO NOT** share your Master Password. If either is lost, the data is mathematically impossible to recover.
